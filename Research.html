    <p>I like knot invariants that tell you about the topology of the knot but also have nice combinatorial* descriptions. 
    It's even better when they generalize to links or tangles. </p>

    <p>The Levine-Tristram signature and Alexander polynomial are two such invariants. While they are both classical invariants (i.e.
    in many introductory textbooks), some of their combinatorial descriptions are relatively new and lesser known. Much of my current work focuses on 
    these descriptions.</p>

    <p>There are other topologically-defined invariants (e.g. knot Floer homology, Casson-Gordon) that I want to find 
    combinatorial descriptions for, and there are theories which are heavily combinatorial (e.g. Vassiliev invariants, Gauss diagrams, virtual knots) 
    whose topological implications I don't understand. </p>
